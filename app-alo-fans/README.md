# Configuring a profile to build APKs

To generate an .apk, modify the eas.json by adding one of the following properties in a build profile:

* developmentClient to true (default)
* distribution to internal
* android.buildType to apk
* android.gradleCommand to :app:assembleRelease, :app:assembleDebug or any other gradle command that produces .apk

1. run this to login:
```bash
eas login
```

2. copy this in eas.json

   ```bash
   {
   "build": {
      "preview": {
         "android": {
         "buildType": "apk"
         }
      },
      "preview2": {
         "android": {
         "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
         }
      },
      "preview3": {
         "developmentClient": true
      },
      "preview4": {
         "distribution": "internal"
      },
      "production": {}
   }
   }

   ```
   Now you can run your build with the following command:
  
   ```bash
   eas build -p android --profile preview
   ```
